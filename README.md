# Usage

First, the song of the "score" will be played.
The "score" is an array in a program.
Now, there is a score to play the Ending theme of "Mizutamari Bond".
If you want to change it to another song, change the array in the file, "Demo.cs".

# Note

Unfortunately the project to create the score was being created in Python, but it has not been completed.
If you want to create a score, please read my program and understand how to create it yourself.
